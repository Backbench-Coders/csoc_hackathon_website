            The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events
            with the ultimate aim of ending British rule in India. It lasted
            from 1857 to 1947.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian
            independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly
            formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders
            seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in
            British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The
            first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards
            self-rule by the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate, Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O.
            Chidambaram Pillai. The last stages of the self-rule struggle from
            the 1920s was characterized by Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy
            of non-violence and civil disobedience. Intellectuals such as
            Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra
            Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like
            Sarojini Naidu, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the
            emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom
            struggle. B. R. Ambedkar championed the cause of the disadvantaged
            sections of Indian society.

            We at Codeshack, want to celebrate our 75th Independence Day and
            take part in Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav by building a cool website
            showcasing the glory of our independence and some unsung freedom
            fighters.

            Freedom Fighters like Bhagat Singh, Mangal Pandey, and Sukdev
            Thapar, to name a few, were iconic revolutionary nationalists who
            sacrificed their lives, and people also recall them through
            observing anniversaries and viewing popular culture. Anyhow, history
            has erased the contributions of Dalit freedom fighters who equally
            contributed to making India a Democratic country.
